<h2>2. Remove Palindromic Subsequences</h2>
Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
<br/>
Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
<br/>
A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.
<br/>
A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Input</h3>
First line contains variable t which represents number of test cases.<br/>
For every testcase there is single line is single string.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Output</h3>
For every test case print the minimum number of steps to make the string empty.<br/>
<br/> 
Example 1:<br/>
Input: s = "ababa"<br/>
Output: 1<br/>
Explanation: String is already palindrome<br/>
<br/>
Example 2:<br/>
Input: s = "abb"<br/>
Output: 2<br/>
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". <br/>
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".<br/>
<br/>
Example 3:<br/>
Input: s = "baabb"<br/>
Output: 2<br/>
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". <br/>
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".<br/>
<br/>
Example 4:<br/>
Input: s = ""<br/>
Output: 0<br/>
 
<br/>
Constraints:<br/>
1<=t<=1000<br/>
0 <= s.length <= 1000<br/>
s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'<br/>
